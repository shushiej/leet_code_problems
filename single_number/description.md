### 136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

### Solution
This one took a few attempts because there were a few test cases with over a 1000 values, so I kept getting `time limit exceeded`.
