### 235.Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a **node to be a descendant of itself**).”

Given binary search tree:  `root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]`

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Note:**

* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.


### Solution
Using recursion you can traverse the binary tree to find the last common node between `p` and `q`.

**Algorithm**

1. Start traversing the tree from the root node.
2. If both the nodes p and q are in the right subtree, then continue the search with right subtree starting step 1.
3. If both the nodes p and q are in the left subtree, then continue the search with left subtree starting step 1.
4. If both step 2 and step 3 are not true, this means we have found the node which is common to node p's and q's subtrees. and hence we return this common node as the LCA.
